# grandpa bitcion

Meet Grandpa Bitcoin, who wants to give bitcoin to his grandbaby, Isolde, on her day of birth, for redemption when she turns 18. He deposited funds to a wallet, made a seed plate, and gives it to her dad for safekeeping in the family safe until she's of age.  

He'd like to provide a url to the address, so dad, and later, Isolde can learn about sound money, without having to standup a wallet of their own, right away. Grandpa plans to give a little with each birthday. So this will be a series of annual deposit-only transactions. (If only Grandpa Bitcoin could by an insurance product to protect Isolde's wealth for 18 years ðŸ¤”)
