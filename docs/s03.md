## render the dashboard
I want to pull in DaisyUI. Let's write the test that would make me write the code to do that.

Constructing the first test in ```page.spec.tsx```, the simplest render:
```tsx
        it('renders dashboard headline', () => {
            render(<Dashboard />) ;

            expect(screen.getByRole('heading').textContent).toContain("DASHBOARD")         

        })
```

I get the error ```Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled"```

Why? Probably the ```jest.config.ts``` made [previously](s01-02.md) by ```npm init jest@latest``` is incorrect for nextJS. I could start over with
```npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest``` but that's a javascript not typescript setup. I copy a known good ```jest.config.ts`` from official [nextjs instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/jest#manual-setup)


Failure to compile is a test failure. Test is now failing to compile for the expected reasons: ```ReferenceError: render is not defined```. Add the import 
```tsx
import {render,screen} from '@testing-library/react';
``` 
and get the next failure ```ReferenceError: Dashboard is not defined```

Add the import
```tsx
import Dashboard from './page';
```

And replace the ```page.tsx``` made by nextJs with the simplest thing that could possibly work:

```tsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>DASHBOARD</h1>
      <Details />
    </div>
  )

}
```

Test pass. Onto DaisyUI.
