## render the dashboard
I want to pull in DaisyUI. Let's write the test that would make me write the code to do that.

Constructing the first test in ```page.spec.tsx```, the simplest render:
```tsx
        it('renders dashboard headline', () => {
            render(<Dashboard />) ;

            expect(screen.getByRole('heading').textContent).toContain("DASHBOARD")         

        })
```

I get the error ```Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled"```
### jsx puzzler

Why? Probably the ```jest.config.ts``` made [previously](s01-02.md) by ```npm init jest@latest``` is incorrect for nextJS. I could start over with
```npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest``` but that's a javascript not typescript setup. I copy a known good ```jest.config.ts`` from official [nextjs instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/jest#manual-setup)

Test is now failing to compile for the expected reasons: ```ReferenceError: render is not defined```. Add the import 
```tsx
import {render,screen} from '@testing-library/react';
``` 
and get the next failure ```ReferenceError: Dashboard is not defined```

Add the import
```tsx
import Dashboard from './page';
```

And replace the ```page.tsx``` made by nextJs with the simplest thing that could possibly work:

```tsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>DASHBOARD</h1>
      <Details />
    </div>
  )

}
```

Test pass. Onto DaisyUI. 

### daisyUI

[Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) enhances tailwind CSS with numerous pre-built templates and components. 

What test might I write causing me to bring it in for tables? I can't think of what testably distinguishes DaisyUI tables from regular ones, but I can write a general table test
```tsx
        it('renders transaction column headers date, amount and status', () => {
            render(<Dashboard />) ;

  
            expect(screen.getByRole('columnheader', {name:/date/i}));

        })
```

And to get this to pass, following [Lim's instruction](https://www.amazon.com/NextJS-13-React-Crash-Course-ebook/dp/B0CG67TMLX/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1), I install daisy
```bash
npm i -D daisyui@latest
```

Add it to the tailwind.config.js under plugins:
```ts
 plugins: [require('daisyui')],
```


And paste a Daisy [table component](https://daisyui.com/components/table/)
tweaking one of the column headers to be *date*.

Test is passing. 

Because Daisy, remove existing css styles in ```/app/globals.css``` to have just the tailwind essentials
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

```
### who's my customer?

I'm leaning on ```npm test``` to see my todo list.
```tsx
    it.todo('should render the transaction amount');
    it.todo('should render the transaction date');
    it.todo('should render the transaction confirmation status');
```

And want to work this one item at a time. To know that, I'd need to know who my customer is. I've not been told. If paired in I'd ask the product owner. Yet we're not collaborating in realtime. My choice is to ask questions and wait, or charge ahead and risk implementing a misunderstanding. 

Either is waste.

I'll take the latter, don the product owner cap, and program for the customer I know better: an invention. I know the lending business a litle better than insurance, but some of this might apply to lending. 

So meet Larry, who is no bitcoiner but willing to loan his good friend Bob the borrower, money at interest that is backed by bitcoin. If Larry could know one thing before wiring the funds to Bob what would it be? That an amount of collateral is posted. 


So I'll begin there and plumb *amount* through, front-end to back-end service. I'm taking a vertical slice (one data element front to back) rather than a layer (a whole front end with no back end).  There will be mocks.
